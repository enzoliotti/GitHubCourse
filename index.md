This is my first Git file.
I need to write something in it.

I'll start with  a title and the date.

This is the title 2019 06 04

I added an extra line

I am adding an extra bit of work to commit for a third change.

The next line is ablout dogs and cats. They normally don't like each other. 
I prefer dogs although cats are fine too.
Elephants are very large animals.
